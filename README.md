### Week #1 Report
We started implementing Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap together (especially for the login and registration pages). We are still working on formatting the webpage. In order to run this application:

1. Download the source code.
2. Unzip the directory.
3. Access the unzipped directory using terminal.
4. Run "rails s".
5. Go to your preferred browser, and type in "localhost:3000".

**NOTE:** Make sure that you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed locally. We are still figuring out how to host it on an accessible server.
