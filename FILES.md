# Description of Modified Directories and Files:
Under the main directory, *Gemfile* is the file we use to download different gems (or packages); these installations are represented in *Gemfile.lock*. Both *config.ru* and *faye.ru* were modified to support the Thin server and Faye. 

## /app
### /assets
Under **/javascripts** and **/stylesheets**, we have our unique Javascript and CSS for the webpage. Functions for WebSocket events are specified in javascripts/websockets.js. Our styles for the website are mostly in stylesheets/index.css.

### /controllers
There are three files under this directory: application_controller.rb, chat_controller.rb, and users_controller.rb. *chat_controller.rb* identifies the users in the chatroom at the time. *users_controller.rb* holds functions for:
1. registering (and creating) new users,
2. delivering a confirmation email to registered users,
3. updating the user information,
4. deleting the user account,
5. signing into the chat, and
6. checking the sign-in information.

### /mailers
The files in this directory allows confirmation emails to be sent to a registered user.

### /models
*chat.rb* creates an association between the chat and user. *user.rb* defines the password specificities.

### /views
#### /chat
*index.html.erb* was our prototype of the chat dashboard. We now call to *dashboard.html.erb* for access. (**NOTE:** This will be modified so each user has their own dashboard).

#### /layouts
*application.html.erb* was modified when we first attempted to integrate Bootstrap into the Rails environment. Both *mailer.html.erb* and *mailer.text.erb* were generated by Rails.

#### /user_mailer
*welcome_email.html.erb* and *welcome_email.text.erb* both have the content that gets sent to a user after they have registered in MercuriChat.

#### /users
* *_form.html.erb* contains the registration form in "Get Started".
* *about.html.erb* is currently blank.
** It will contain information about MercuriChat.
* *index.html.erb* is the main page of MercuriChat.
** We currently have this routed as the root of our application.
* *indexnot.html.erb* was created for debugging purposes.
* *show.html.erb* is currently being used as the user's profile page.
** We are working on having separate pages for:
*** editing your profile page, and
*** viewing others' profiles.
* *sign-in.html.erb* was our prototype sign-in page.
** This will be removed in the production version.
* *sign_in.html.erb* is the page that allows registered users to sign in, and access the chat application.
* *team.html.erb* is currently blank.
** In the future, it may contain information about the developers.

## /config
Under this directory, we modified *application.rb* and *routes.rb*. 
* *application.rb* configures WebSockes on Rails and configures Action Mailer.
* *routes.rb* defines paths to different parts of the application.

### /environments
*development.rb* primarily configures Action Mailer and assets.rb.

### /initializers
*assets.rb* precompiles the scripts and stylesheets under /app/assets.

**NOTE:** Remove *devise.rb* and *high_voltage.rb* under this directory at some point.

## /db
Under this directory, *schema.rb* defines the data for the table "users". This includes:
1. first name,
2. last name,
3. email, 
4. password hash,
5. password salt,
6. password,
7. time created, and
8. time updated.

This file also creates a new table, "chats", and it also contains the time created and the time updated.

### /migrate
* *20160321200213_create_users.rb* defines the function, change, which creates the "users" table described in *schema.rb*.
* *20160412080749_create_chats.rb* defines the function, change, which creates the "chats" table described in *schema.rb*.

## /rack_middleware
*dashboard_controller.rb* contains the class, Websocket. It:
* defines and initializes the application;
* listens for a connection attempt;
* creates a new WebSocket once a request has been found;
* creates a string of the user's name and their sent data,
* for each user in that chatroom, the socket broadcasts that string;
* handles connection when it closes; and
* decrypts session cookies.

*dbc.rb* has similar content.

## /vendor
Under this directory, we have **/assets**. All the directories and files under /assets are Bootstrap files.
