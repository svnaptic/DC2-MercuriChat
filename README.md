# MercuriChat

The goal of this project is to create a simple web client that uses TCP/WebSockets to connect to a chat server using HTML5, HTML5 WebSockets, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails.

# Progress (Week 03/29)
We started implementing Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap together (especially for the login and registration pages). We are still working on formatting the webpage. In order to run this application locally:

1. Download the source code.
2. Unzip the directory.
3. Access the unzipped directory using terminal. You must be inside of "MercuriChat".
4. Run "rails s".
5. Go to your preferred browser, and type in "localhost:3000".

**NOTE:** Make sure that you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed locally. We are still figuring out how to host it on an accessible server.
